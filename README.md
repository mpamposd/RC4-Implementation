⚠️ Disclaimer This RC4 implementation is for educational and research purposes only. RC4 is considered cryptographically insecure and should NOT be used in production or to protect sensitive data. Use modern ciphers like AES instead.

# RC4 Stream Cipher (Educational Implementation)

This repository demonstrates how the RC4 stream cipher works internally,
including the Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA) and the Pseudo-Random Generation
Algorithm (PRGA).  

**Note:** RC4 is deprecated and insecure. Do not use it in real-world cryptography.
