# RC4 Stream Cipher (Educational Implementation)

This repository demonstrates how the RC4 stream cipher works internally,
including the Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA) and the Pseudo-Random Generation
Algorithm (PRGA).  

**Note:** RC4 is deprecated and insecure. Do not use it in real-world cryptography.
